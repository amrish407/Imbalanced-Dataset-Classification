# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains multiple machine learning projects implemented using Python. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using different machine learning algorithms.

## Projects Included

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Algorithms Used:** Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression
- **Dataset:** Credit card transaction data
- **Objective:** Identify fraudulent transactions using classification techniques.
- **Files:**
  - `cradit_card_fraud_using_naive_bayes.ipynb`
  - `Credit_card_fraud_using_logistic_regression.ipynb`

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Algorithm Used:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Dataset:** Customer churn dataset
- **Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn or not based on historical data.
